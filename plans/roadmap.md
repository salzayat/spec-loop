# Roadmap

This roadmap orders future capabilities and teaches the intended growth path. OpenSpec changes contain
detailed requirements and tasks; this file contains only sequencing, status, and links to the governing
contract.

## Milestone Tracking

| Phase                                   | Governing changes                                             | Status   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Repository evolution conventions        | `add-repository-evolution-markers`                            | Complete |
| Executable PR and dependency governance | `add-executable-pr-and-dependency-governance`                 | Complete |
| Foundation                              |                                                               | Complete |
| Agent harness and MCP governance        | `improve-agentic-boiler-governance`                           | Complete |
| Template and example expansion          | `add-second-example-package`, `add-template-onboarding-guide` | Complete |
| Fork rename automation                  | `add-project-rename-tooling`                                  | Complete |

The repository evolution milestone comes first because it establishes the conventions used to plan and
sequence every later capability. The executable PR and dependency governance milestone extends those
conventions with safe body-file handling and dependency readiness checks. The initial foundation is
represented by accepted specs and the runnable `hello` project. The governance milestone is complete because
its change is archived and its accepted requirements are present.

The template and example expansion milestone turns the repository into a usable template for spec and
harness engineering, not just a description of one. `add-second-example-package` comes first because it
demonstrates Nx project boundaries and inter-package dependency sequencing in working code; it is archived.
`add-template-onboarding-guide` comes next because it references `packages/greeter` as part of its
fork/rename/replace-markers checklist, so its predecessor had to exist and be archived first. GitHub's
"Template repository" setting was checked and was already enabled on the hosted remote, and `.github/`
already carries PR/issue templates, CODEOWNERS, dependabot, and CI, so no further governing change is
needed to finish this milestone.

The fork rename automation milestone turns `TEMPLATE.md`'s manual identity-rename table into a single
command (`npm run rename`), because the manual table was already missing several tracked locations (the
npm scope, `tsconfig.base.json`, `openspec/config.yaml`, the `spec-loop-governance` spec directory)
that a fork owner following it verbatim would leave inconsistent. It comes after the template and example
expansion milestone because it renames the packages that milestone introduced.

Roadmap changes are ordered left to right within a milestone and top to bottom across milestones. A later
change may be selected only after every earlier governing change is archived and verified. Use `Pending` for
work not started, `In progress` for an active change, `Blocked` when a named dependency is not ready, and
`Complete` only for archived changes with recorded verification. Every row points to a governing change; it
never duplicates that change's requirements or task checklist.
